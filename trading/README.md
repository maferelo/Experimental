# Trading Bot

The idea is to create a trading bot with the following features:

- [ ] 1. Scrap historical stock data
- [ ] 2. Scrap historical news
- [ ] 3. Correlate news with stock data
- [ ] 4. Train a distilled model to predict stock prices

## Features

### 1. Scrap historical stock data

The first step is to scrap historical stock data. We can use the Yahoo Finance API to get the data. We can use the `yfinance` library to get the data.

### 2. Scrap historical news

The second step is to scrap historical news. We can use the `newsapi` library to get the data.

### 3. Correlate news with stock data

The third step is to correlate news with stock data. We can use the `pandas` library to correlate the data.

### 4. Train a distilled model to predict stock prices

The fourth step is to train a distilled model to predict stock prices. We can use the `tensorflow` library to train the model.

## Stack

- Language: Python
- Libraries: `yfinance`, `newsapi`, `pandas`, `tensorflow`, `tensorflow`
- Deployment: Docker compose with a Flask API 

## To Do

- [x] 1. Create a Dockerfile
- [x] 2. Create a docker-compose file
- [ ] 3. Create a Flask API

## Setup

### Virtual environment

Create a virtual environment using `venv`:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
